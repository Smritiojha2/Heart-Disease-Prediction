# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Using various ML algorithms to predict whether a person has the heart disease or not.
The dataset is extracted from kaggle under heart disease prediction. Firstly i imported the required libraries for displaying and visualizing the dataset. 
Next the dataset was analysed using barplots and checked the target variable for equality
Now the categorical columns were converted to dummy variables for easier appliccation of ML algorithms
The other columns were scaled accordingly so remove bias
The machine algorithms used are Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest and SVM
We see through the accuracy scores that Logistic Regression gives the best prediction for heart disease dataset with accuracy score of around 93%
